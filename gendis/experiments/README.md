### Dependent vs independent discovery

#### Benchmark datasets

#### Artificial dataset

Run `python3 dependent_vs_independent_artificial.py`. Four SVG images will be created in the `results/` directory. One displaying the generated train and test set (`data.svg`), one depicting the two discovered shapelets of both approaches (`shapelets.svg`) and two scatter plots that display the distances to two extracted shapelets (`scatter_.*.svg`).

### Simple artificial two-class problem that cannot be solved by brute-force approach

Run `python3 single_shapelet`. Two SVG images will be generated. One displaying the generated data (`shap_artificial.svg`) and one displaying the extracted shapelet of three approaches (`extracted_shapelets.svg`)
